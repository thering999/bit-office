## What is Bit Office

Bit Office gives AI automation a **visible, controllable workspace**. Different AI models collaborate as one team under a Team Leader — planning, coding, reviewing, and delivering in a single flow, all rendered in a live pixel-art office you can watch, control, and share.

What makes it different: **agents get better over time**. Rate each project on creativity, visual quality, interaction, completeness, and engagement. Your ratings and review patterns are stored as persistent memory — the next time the team plans a project, they know what scored low and actively improve on it.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx bit-office
```

That's it. This will:

1. Start a local gateway daemon
2. Open the pixel-art office UI in your browser
3. Auto-detect installed AI CLIs (Claude, Codex, Gemini, Aider, OpenCode)
4. Generate a pair code for mobile access

## Features

### Multi-Agent Teams

A **Team Leader** coordinates specialists like Developer and Code
Reviewer to plan, implement, and validate tasks automatically.

### Multi-Model Workflows

Run **Claude, Codex, Gemini, Aider, and OpenCode** together in one
pipeline, letting each model focus on what it does best.

### Pixel Office Workspace

Watch agents work in real time inside a **PixiJS pixel-art office**,
with live status, logs, and progress visualization.

### Instant Preview & Rating

Every completed task generates an **auto preview**. Rate the result
across five dimensions — your feedback becomes **persistent memory**
that shapes how agents approach the next project.

### Self-Improving Agents

Review patterns, tech preferences, and project ratings are stored
across sessions. Agents **learn what you value** and adapt — low
visual scores lead to richer designs, recurring review failures get
avoided automatically.

### Token Cost Visibility

Track **token usage per agent and per team** in real time so you always
know the cost of each run.

### Live Sharing & Mobile Control

Invite others to watch progress, leave feedback, or manage sessions
directly from your phone.

### Cross-Device Sync

Real-time collaboration powered by **WebSocket, Ably, and Telegram
channels**.

### Project History

Every run is saved with a **replayable preview**, letting you revisit
results and build on previous work.

## Team Workflow

| Phase | What Happens | Your Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Create** | Team Lead gathers intent and scope | Describe what to build |
| **Design** | Team Lead proposes implementation plan | Approve or request changes |
| **Execute** | Developer implements, Reviewer validates | Monitor or cancel |
| **Complete** | Preview and summary delivered | Rate, give feedback, or end project |

Ratings persist as agent memory. The next project starts with lessons from the last one.

Full details in [team-workflow.md](team-workflow.md).

## Use Cases

- **AI-native prototyping** — go from idea to working preview in one session
- **Feature spikes** — rapid implementation with continuous preview feedback
- **Multi-model experiments** — compare how different AI backends approach the same task
- **Live demos** — show autonomous development workflows to your team or audience

## Run from Source

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+
- **pnpm**
- At least one AI CLI installed: `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `aider`, or `opencode`

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/longyangxi/bit-office.git
cd bit-office
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

### Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `pnpm dev` | Web + gateway in dev mode |
| `pnpm dev:web` | Web only (Next.js) |
| `pnpm dev:gateway` | Gateway only |
| `pnpm dev:desktop` | Tauri desktop app (dev mode) |
| `pnpm build` | Build all packages |
| `pnpm build:desktop` | Build Tauri .app + .dmg |
| `pnpm start` | Build web and start gateway |

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `WORKSPACE` | No | Agent working directory |
| `ABLY_API_KEY` | No | Remote real-time channel |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKENS` | No | One token per bot/agent (comma-separated) |
| `WS_PORT` | No | Gateway WebSocket port (default: 9090) |
| `WEB_DIR` | No | Override served web build directory |

## Desktop App (Tauri)

Bit Office also ships as a native **macOS desktop app** powered by [Tauri](https://tauri.app). The app bundles the gateway as a sidecar — no terminal, no browser, just launch and go.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+, **pnpm**
- **Rust** toolchain — install via: `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`

### Dev Mode

```bash
pnpm dev:desktop
```

This starts the gateway (port 9099), web dev server, and Tauri window in one command.

### Build Release

```bash
pnpm build:desktop
```

Produces `Bit Office.app` and `.dmg` at:
```
apps/desktop/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/Bit Office.app
apps/desktop/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/Bit Office_0.1.0_aarch64.dmg
```

The release app:
- Auto-starts an embedded gateway (sidecar)
- Connects via local WebSocket (port 9090)
- Minimizes to system tray on close
- Reopens from Dock click

### Port Convention

| Mode | Gateway Port | Web |
|------|-------------|-----|
| `npx bit-office` | 9090 | Bundled at same port |
| `pnpm dev` | 9099 | localhost:3000 |
| `pnpm dev:desktop` | 9099 | Tauri window → localhost:3000 |
| Desktop app (release) | 9090 | Tauri window → static export |
